      <description>&lt;p&gt;In sixth grade, during the physics lesson, I learned that two objects cannot exist in the same space. Obvious, right?&#xA;Well, Mr. BunÄƒu (the physics teacher) just made obvious something that everybody instinctively knows. I certainly knew this, but didn&amp;rsquo;t put it into words and it was amazing for me at the time what a simple concept, how obvious, yet I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to formulate it in to words.&#xA;This is why words mean things, putting concepts into words helps other people better understand your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
